## 🚨 Critical Issues to Address

### **Immediate Blockers:**
1. **No Database**: All data is mock/hardcoded
2. **No Real Authentication**: Login/register don't work
3. **No Data Persistence**: Forms don't save data
4. **No API Integration**: Frontend not connected to backend
5. **No State Management**: No real data flow

## 🛠 Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack ✅
- **Next.js 15**: React framework with App Router
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling
- **Framer Motion**: Smooth animations
- **React Query**: Data fetching structure (needs backend)
- **Zustand**: State management structure (needs implementation)

### Backend Requirements ❌
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM (not set up)
- **Authentication**: JWT-based auth system (not implemented)
- **API Routes**: RESTful endpoints (partially implemented)
- **Real-time**: Socket.IO integration (structure only)
- **File Upload**: Image handling for profiles/teams (not implemented)

## 📊 Realistic Implementation Statistics

- **🎨 Frontend/UI**: 85% Complete
- **🔧 Backend Infrastructure**: 15% Complete
- **🔐 Authentication**: 10% Complete (UI only)
- **📱 Core Features**: 40% Complete (UI without functionality)
- **🗄️ Database**: 0% Complete
- **⚡ Real-time Features**: 5% Complete (structure only)
- **📊 Overall Functionality**: 40% Complete

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Current Demo
```bash
cd laro-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Note**: Currently shows UI with mock data only. No real functionality.

### Demo Login (Mock Only)
- **Email**: `courtking@example.com`
- **Password**: `password123`
- **Result**: Shows success message but doesn't create real session

## 🎯 Success Criteria for 100% Completion

### **Must Complete:**
❌ **Database Integration**: Set up Prisma with real data models
❌ **Authentication**: Working login/register with JWT tokens
❌ **Team Management**: Create, edit, delete teams with real data
❌ **Game Scheduling**: Create, join, manage games with persistence
❌ **Court Discovery**: Real court data with search and booking
❌ **User Profiles**: Complete CRUD operations for user data
❌ **Data Persistence**: All forms must save to database

### **Currently Working:**
✅ **UI/UX Design**: Basketball-themed, responsive interface
✅ **Component Library**: Complete set of reusable components
✅ **Navigation**: Routing and layout structure
✅ **Form Interfaces**: All forms designed (but not functional)

## 📝 Current Limitations

- **No Data Persistence**: All data resets on page refresh
- **Mock Authentication**: Login doesn't create real sessions
- **Static Content**: All data is hardcoded
- **No Real Interactions**: Buttons show success messages only
- **No Backend**: Forms don't connect to actual database

**The platform has excellent UI foundation but requires significant backend development to become functional.**
