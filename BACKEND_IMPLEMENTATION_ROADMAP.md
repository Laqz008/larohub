# üèÄ LaroHub Backend Implementation Roadmap

## Current State Analysis

### ‚úÖ What's Working
- **Database Schema**: Comprehensive Prisma schema with all required models
- **Basic Authentication**: Login/register endpoints with JWT tokens
- **Some API Routes**: Teams, basic user endpoints partially implemented

## Detailed Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Fix Core Authentication (30 minutes)

**Files to modify:**
- `src/lib/auth.ts` - Complete auth utilities
- `src/app/api/auth/*/route.ts` - Fix all auth endpoints
- `src/middleware.ts` - Add route protection

### Step 2: Complete API Endpoints (2-3 hours)

**Missing/Incomplete Endpoints:**
```
POST   /api/teams/{id}/join
DELETE /api/teams/{id}/leave
PUT    /api/teams/{id}
DELETE /api/teams/{id}

POST   /api/games
PUT    /api/games/{id}
DELETE /api/games/{id}
POST   /api/games/{id}/join
DELETE /api/games/{id}/leave

POST   /api/courts
PUT    /api/courts/{id}
DELETE /api/courts/{id}
POST   /api/courts/{id}/reviews

PUT    /api/users/profile
POST   /api/users/avatar
GET    /api/users/{id}/stats
```

### Step 3: Database Seeding (1 hour)

**Create comprehensive seed data:**
- 50+ realistic users with varied skill levels
- 20+ teams with proper member relationships
- 30+ courts across different locations
- 100+ games with various statuses
- Realistic statistics and achievements

### Step 4: Frontend Integration (2-3 hours)

**Replace mock data with real API calls:**
- Update all components to use real API endpoints
- Implement proper loading states
- Add error handling and retry logic
- Update environment configuration

### Step 5: Real-time Features (2-3 hours)

**Socket.io Implementation:**
- Game status updates
- Chat functionality
- Live notifications
- Real-time player locations

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Success Criteria
- [ ] All CRUD operations work without mock data
- [ ] Authentication flow is complete and secure
- [ ] Database operations are fast and reliable
- [ ] Error handling provides meaningful feedback

### Phase 2 Success Criteria
- [ ] Search and filtering work across all entities
- [ ] Statistics are calculated accurately
- [ ] Real-time features work smoothly
- [ ] Performance is acceptable under load

### Phase 3 Success Criteria
- [ ] File uploads work reliably
- [ ] Advanced game features are intuitive
- [ ] Social features encourage engagement
- [ ] System is ready for production deployment

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Database Performance**: Add proper indexes and query optimization
- **Authentication Security**: Implement rate limiting and security headers
- **Real-time Scalability**: Use Redis for Socket.io scaling
- **File Upload Security**: Validate file types and implement virus scanning

### Development Risks
- **Time Constraints**: Prioritize core functionality over nice-to-have features
- **Testing Coverage**: Implement automated tests for critical paths
- **Documentation**: Maintain API documentation for frontend integration
- **Deployment**: Prepare staging environment for testing

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Action**: Start with Phase 1 implementation
2. **Team Coordination**: Ensure frontend team is ready for API integration
3. **Testing Strategy**: Set up automated testing for new endpoints
4. **Monitoring**: Implement logging and error tracking
5. **Documentation**: Create API documentation for team reference
